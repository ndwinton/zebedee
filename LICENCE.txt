Zebedee would not have been possible without the use of a
large amount of freely-available software to do all the
really hard stuff. I gratefully acknowledge the
contributions made by the authors of the following software
packages:

Zebedee uses the "Blowfish" encryption algorithm devised by
Bruce Schneier. The implementation is by Eric Young and is
covered by the following copyright:

  The license and distribution terms for any publically
  available version or derivative of this code cannot be
  changed.  i.e. this code cannot simply be copied and put
  under another distrubution license [including the GNU
  Public License.]
  
  The reason behind this being stated in this direct manner
  is past experience in code simply being copied and the
  attribution removed from it and then being distributed as
  part of other packages. This implementation was a
  non-trivial and unpaid effort.

By default Zebedee is built using an aribtrary precision integer
arithmetic library derived from the sources to mirrordir-0.10.49
which in turn derived this from the Python sources. The copyright
is as follows:
 
 huge-number.c: arbitrary precision integer library from Python
 sources.
 This has nothing to do with cryptography.

 This file was taken from the Python source for `long' type
 integers. I have changed it to compile independently of the
 Python source, and added the optimisation that GNU C can use 31
 bit digits instead of Python's 15 bit. You can download the
 original from www.python.org. This file bears little resemblance
 to the original though - paul

Zebedee uses the Secure Hash Algorith (SHA) the code for
which was derived from Uwe Hollerbach's SHA module for perl.
The code contains the following statement:

  NIST Secure Hash Algorithm heavily modified by Uwe

  implementation as found in Applied Cryptography by Bruce
  Schneier
